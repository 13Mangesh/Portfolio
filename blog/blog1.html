							<h1 class="display-2 font-weight-bold">React Native - What & Why?</h1>

							<p>In today's era it is not wrong to say that mobiles have become the inseparable part of our lives. 
								And what makes the mobile phones so great is the vast amount of applications and games available for them. 
								There are numerous ways available for one to make an application. Mainly the apps are divided as native apps and hybrid apps. 
								The problem with the native approach i.e. app development using Android studio for android and using Xcode for ios 
								is that they have to rewrite whole application for each platform separately and maintain them while the problem with hybrid apps is 
								its performance. Here React native comes into the picture.
								</p>
							<p>
								<img src="../images/reactnative.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
							</p>
							<p>Before diving into React Native let's understand first what is React JS.</p>
							<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">What is React JS</h2>
							<p>React JS is a javascript library that is used to develop User Interfaces. 
								The common misconception about React JS is that it takes our JSX code and renders it on the browser. 
								It is wrong actually! The React JS is platform-independent it can be used to render anything. 
								The main use of React JS to build a tree, a component tree. 
								There is another library the ReactDOM library which takes all of our code and converts it into the HTML tree 
								as we can see on the browser.</p>
							<p>
								<img src="../images/React.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
							</p>
							<p>Another important concept about React JS is its components. 
								The whole application or website built with React JS is build using reusable components. 
								This could save a lot of code and time too!</p>
							<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">What is React Native</h2>
							<p>
								Like ReactDOM which renders the HTML components on the DOM, React Native also uses the React JS 
								to render the platform-specific components (Widgets) on the mobile screen. 
								<br>
								For eg. The React Native code for Button will be,
								<br>
								export default function test {
								<br>
								&nbsp;return (
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;View&gt;
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Button title = "Click" /&gt;
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/View&gt;
								<br>
								&nbsp;)
								<br>
								}
								<br>
								
							</p>
							<p>It looks similar to JSX and looks like it uses HTML elements but that is not the case here. 
								The View is not an HTML element. React Native provides a set of different elements which then 
								compiled into platform-specific widgets. Now this sentence defines the important property of React 
								Native that it compiles the components into "Native Widgets". Why is it important? As we discussed 
								above the Hybrid app have the Pros of writing code ones and run it on multiple platforms. One such 
								framework to build a hybrid app is Ionic, but the problem is the bridge technology that converts a 
								web app into an android or ios app is Cordova, it just wraps the web app into android or ios app. 
								As the complexity of the app rises the performance of the application decreases. But, React Native 
								compiles the UI into Native widgets, thus performing like a native application. Now, it is very important 
								to remember the logic of our app the Javascript code will not be compiled instead React Native will provide 
								a VM to run the Javascript code and that thread is attached to our application. But the heavy task of 
								rendering UI is done natively. Also we have to write all the logic once and then we can use it on various 
								platforms. It drastically saves time if we go by the Native development approach.
							</p>
							<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Pros of React Native</h2>
							<p class="h4">Cross-Platform</p>
							<p>React Native is supported cross-platform. 
								The new versions of React Native will also support the TV OS. 
								If we want to write only one code base for our application then React Native is the way to go.</p>
							<p class="h4">Performance</p>
							<p>React Native will give Native like performance in spite of the complexity of the application.</p>
							<p class="h4">Support</p>
							<p>React Native is used and backed by a tech giant like Facebook, so it is not going anywhere in the near future.</p>
							<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Cons of React Native</h2>
							<p class="h4">Buggy, Frequent Updates</p>
							<p>The React Native is still buggy, updates frequently so we have to update our code also time to time. 
								The breaking changes occur every 6 months or so.</p>
							<p class="h4">Manual Work</p>
							<p>The manual work in React Native is more. 
								The number of components provided by the React Native is very less. 
								It provides around 10-15 components while Ionic provides around 40-45 components out of the box and with styling. 
								Another problem of React Native is we have to heavily stylize our components. 
								We have to make our own components with the help of provided basic components and for a simple application it is not efficient.</p>
